# CubeStormer

CubeStormer is an app created for an IEEE NITK project by the same name.
It takes photos of the cube, processes the orientation, and solves it.

The program uses Rodger Combs' implementation of Koceimba's Two Phase algorithm to solve the cube.

The output is sent to a microcontroller using bluetooth (under development), which is used to control the CubeStormer robot, to physically solve the cube.
